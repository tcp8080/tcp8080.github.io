United Nations, 75 years on
联合国75年
The United Nations is marking 75 years since it was founded.
联合国成立75周年。
But the coronavirus means the annual gathering of global leaders at the General Assembly will look very different.
但是，冠状病毒意味着每年在全球大会上聚集的全球领导人看起来将大不相同。
One-on-one meetings have been scrapped and replaced with a series of prerecorded video messages.
一对一会议已被取消，并替换为一系列预先录制的视频消息。
It comes at a time when some say the UN is needed more than ever, with tensions growing between the world's superpowers.
这是在有人说联合国比以往任何时候都更需要联合国的时候，世界各大国之间的紧张关系日益加剧。
Sarah Walton reports.
莎拉·沃尔顿报道。
It's been three quarters of a century since the signing of the UN Charter, overseen by US President Harry. S Truman
自美国总统哈里（Harry）监督《联合国宪章》签署以来已经过去了四分之三世纪。杜鲁门
"There were many that doubted that agreement could ever be reached. But these differences were all forgotten in one unshakeable unity of determination, to find a way to end war."
“有许多人怀疑是否能够达成协议。但是，所有这些分歧都以一种坚定不移的决心统一性被遗忘了，以找到结束战争的方法。”
75 years on, the UN has succeeded in its main aim of avoiding another world war. But it has faced criticism for its ineffectiveness at ending protracted conflicts like the fighting in Yemen, Syria and Libya. And over the years, questions have been raised about whether this global body is still needed.
75年来，联合国成功地避免了另一场世界大战。但是它因无法有效地消除也门，叙利亚和利比亚的旷日持久的冲突而受到批评。多年来，人们对是否仍需要这个全球机构提出了疑问。
Simon Adams is Executive Director of the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect.
西蒙·亚当斯（Simon Adams）是全球保护责任中心的执行主任。
"The UN is going to be relevant as long as we have conflict, as long as we have poverty, as long as we have disease, and as long as we have diplomacy we will need the UN. The question is I guess is not whether it's relevant but whether it is effective in doing its job properly and I think that's definitely where we need to see some improvements."
“只要我们有冲突，只要我们有贫穷，只要我们有疾病，只要我们有外交，我们就将需要联合国。联合国的问题是，我想不是这是相关的，但是它能否有效地正确执行工作，我认为这绝对是我们需要看到一些改进的地方。”
Through the decades the UN has expanded into humanitarian aid and peacekeeping. But its role in international mediation has been hampered by an inability to always create consensus amongst member states.
几十年来，联合国已扩展到人道主义援助和维持和平。但是，它在国际调解中的作用因无法始终在成员国之间达成共识而受到阻碍。
And that's because of growing differences in the personal interests of the UN's leading players and shifting geopolitical dynamics.
这是因为联合国主要参与者的个人利益之间的差异越来越大，而且地缘政治动态也在发生变化。
Sarah Cliffe, Director of NYU's Center on International Cooperation, says tensions are at their highest since the end of the Cold War.
纽约大学国际合作中心主任莎拉·克里夫说，紧张局势是自冷战结束以来的最高水平。
"Certainly we see a situation in which the US has been left on the outside of different debates. But we also see a situation in which others of the permanent 5 members have been left on the outside of debates. So we can say in general that the relationship between the great powers is at a particularly tense stage."
“当然，我们看到了将美国留在不同辩论之外的情况。但是，我们也看到了将常任理事国五国中的其他成员留在辩论之外的情况。因此，我们可以大体说来，大国之间的关系处于特别紧张的阶段。”
And this year's UN General Assembly High level week will afford little opportunity to improve those relationships.
而今年的联合国大会高级别周将几乎没有机会改善这些关系。
Covid-19 restrictions means world leaders cannot gather at the UN headquarters in New York and will instead send video messages.
Covid-19限制意味着世界领导人不能聚集在纽约的联合国总部，而是发送视频消息。
Professor Jean Krasno, Director of International Relations, City College of New York says that means they'll miss out on the chance for personal diplomacy.
纽约城市学院国际关系主任让·克拉斯诺教授表示，这意味着他们将错过个人外交的机会。
"So much goes on over coffee and lunch and in the hallways, in the bathrooms. You know, all kinds of things. People discuss working out solutions or ideas or coming up with things, and that can't happen."
“在咖啡，午餐以及走廊，浴室中，发生了很多事情。您知道各种各样的事情。人们讨论制定解决方案或想法或提出想法，但这是不可能的。”
The UN is now also looking ahead, running a campaign called 'The Future We Want, the UN We Need.' But the unique circumstances of this anniversary during a pandemic, and rising global tensions could well shape its next 75 years.
联合国现在也展望未来，开展名为“我们想要的未来，我们需要的联合国”的运动。但大流行这一周年纪念日的特殊情况以及全球紧张局势的加剧很可能会影响其未来75年。

UNGA president champions multilateralism
联合国大会主席拥护多边主义
The president of the UN General Assembly says multilateralism is important for creating a better future.

Volkan Bozkir made the remarks at a meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN.

He says the United Nations has worked tirelessly to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and has also shaped the norms for international development.

U.S. has no right to demand UN restore Iran sanctions: spokesperson
发言人称美国无权要求联合国恢复对伊朗的制裁
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin says the United States has no right to demand that the UN Security Council invoke sanctions on Iran.
中国外交部发言人王文彬说，美国无权要求联合国安理会对伊朗实施制裁。
"The United States has withdrawn from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, so it is no longer a participant in the deal. The letter sent by the U.S. side on Aug 20 has no legal effect whatsoever. The U.S. side has no right to demand that the Security Council activate the 'snapback' mechanism."
“美国已经退出了《联合全面行动计划》，因此它不再是该交易的参与者。美方在8月20日发送的信没有任何法律效力。美方无权要求安全理事会激活“回弹”机制。”
Wang says over the past weekend, parties to the Iran nuclear agreement, including China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and Germany sent letters to the president of the Security Council to oppose the unilateral U.S. move against Iran.
王说，在过去的一个周末中，包括中国，俄罗斯，法国，英国和德国在内的伊朗核协议的当事方致函安全理事会主席，反对美国单方面反对伊朗的举动。
The U.S. unilaterally invoked the "snapback" last month after its failed attempt in the UN Security Council to extend the arms embargo against Tehran that expires next month.
在联合国安理会扩大对德黑兰的武器禁运的企图于下个月到期后，美国上个月单方面援引了“回弹”。

Dong with the China Academy of Space Technology says the probe will have another two orbital maneuvers in the future.
中国航天技术研究院的董说，该探测器将来还将进行两次轨道操作。

The Spanish Prime Minister says that containing the spread of COVID-19 in and around the country's capital should be given high priority.

UK acts to prevent second lockdown
英国采取行动防止第二次封锁
Time to continue our special series "Guard against the resurgence of COVID-19," focusing on measures against a possible new wave of the coronavirus in autumn and winter.
是时候继续我们的特别系列“警惕COVID-19的复活了”，重点是针对秋季和冬季可能出现的新一轮冠状病毒的措施。
A World Health Organization expert has recently warned that the UK should brace for a second wave of the coronavirus as case numbers have spiked in the wake of relaxed lockdown restrictions.
世界卫生组织的一位专家最近警告说，英国应该为第二轮冠状病毒做好准备，因为随着放宽封锁限制，病例数激增。
UK correspondent Liang Tao has more.
英国通讯员梁涛拥有更多。
Dr. David Nabarro, WHO special envoy for the global Covid-19 response, said "the virus is coming back to UK".
世卫组织全球应对Covid-19的特使大卫·纳巴罗（David Nabarro）博士说：“该病毒正在返回英国”。
"I'm afraid it's coming. I don't like calling it a second wave. I just say there are going to be more spikes and indeed some surges of cases because the virus hasn't changed. It's the same virus that came and caused so much trouble earlier this year."
“恐怕它即将到来。我不喜欢再叫它第二次。我只是说将会有更多的高峰期，而且确实会有一些病例激增，因为这种病毒没有改变。在今年早些时候造成了很多麻烦。”
Dr. Nabarro warned the UK to stay seriously alert again and take necessary control measures.
纳巴罗博士警告英国再次保持高度戒备，并采取必要的控制措施。
"And that's why all the different measures that have been put in place around the world finding people with the disease and getting them to isolate and so on. Plus the precautions that we've got to adopt ourselves still matter an awful lot. And they're gonna go on mattering for the foreseeable future."
“这就是为什么世界各地采取各种不同的措施来找到患有该疾病的人并将其隔离的原因，等等。加上我们必须采取的预防措施仍然非常重要。而且在可预见的将来会继续重要。”
Dr. Nabarro's warning echoes that of Professor Jonathan Van Tam, England deputy chief medical officer, who warned that coronavirus cases were increasing exponentially not only in specific places but across the whole country.
纳巴罗博士的警告与英国副首席医疗官乔纳森·范·坦姆教授的警告相呼应，他警告说，冠状病毒病例不仅在特定地区而且在整个国家呈指数级增长。
"People have relaxed too much. People have relaxed too much. And now is the time for us to reengage and realize that this is a continuing threat to us. This is no longer about disease in those specific hotspots, such as Leicester a few months ago, the northwest more recently. But there is a more general and creeping geographic trend across the UK, across England that disease levels are now beginning to turn up on a wider geographical basis."
“人们放松得太多了。人们放松了太多了。现在是我们重新参与并意识到这对我们的持续威胁的时候了。这不再是那些特定热点地区的疾病，例如莱斯特几个月以前是西北地区。但是，在整个英国和整个英格兰，地理范围的趋势越来越普遍，现在疾病水平开始在更大的地理范围内上升。”
He stressed that people must realize the urgency of the issue otherwise "a bumpy ride" is inevitable.
他强调，人们必须意识到这一问题的紧迫性，否则“颠簸”是不可避免的。
"It is of great concern at this point. This hasn't gone away. This is a virus we're going to have to live with. If we're not careful, if we don't take this incredibly seriously from this point in, we're going to have a bumpy ride over the next few months."
“在这一点上，这是一个令人担忧的问题。这还没有消失。这是我们必须忍受的一种病毒。如果我们不谨慎的话，如果我们从现在起就不认真对待这一点在接下来的几个月里，我们将遇到颠簸。”
Their warnings come after the number of cases in the UK hit 3,000 for two consecutive days after the reopening of most schools, the largest rise since May.
在大多数学校重新开放后，英国的案例数量连续两天达到3,000起，是自5月份以来最大的上升。
As a result, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced new clampdown measures that most social gatherings of more than 6 people will be banned in England from mid-September.
结果，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）宣布了新的镇压措施，从9月中旬开始，英格兰将禁止大多数6人以上的社交聚会。
"I want to be absolutely clear. These measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown. By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open in the knowledge that they are COVID-secure."
“我想绝对清楚。这些措施不是另一个国家封锁。它们的全部目的是避免再次发生国家封锁。通过与社会接触并加强执法，我们可以在知道以下情况的情况下保持学校和企业的开放”它们是COVID安全的。”
The new rules will apply in venues such as pubs and restaurants, as well as in private homes and gardens and public parks.
新规定将适用于酒吧和饭店等场所，以及私人住宅，花园和公园。

Britain may see 50,000 new COVID-19 cases per day: officials
英国官员每天可能会收到50,000个新的COVID-19病例
British officials warn that the country may see 50-thousand new COVID-19 cases per day by mid-October unless intervention is taken to slow the current infection rate.
英国官员警告说，除非采取干预措施以降低目前的感染率，否则该国每天可能会在10月中旬之前收到5万例新的COVID-19病例。
The number of new cases is doubling roughly every seven days, and the country may see 200 deaths per day by mid-November.
新病例的数量大约每7天翻一番，到11月中旬，该国每天可能有200人死亡。
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is on track to increase its testing capacity to curb the infection rate.
英国卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）表示，政府正在努力提高其检测能力以遏制感染率。
"If we can if we can bring forward the goal of 500,000 tests per day, from the end of October, then of course we will. And we are pushing that as hard as we can. We are on track to meet that commitment."
“如果可以的话，从10月底开始，我们每天可以提出500,000个测试的目标，那么我们当然会做到。我们将尽力而为地推动这一目标。我们有望实现这一承诺。”
Hancock adds that the government will pay low-income people 500 pounds, or 640 U.S. dollars, if they are asked to self-isolate for 14 days, while those breaking quarantine will face fines.
汉考克补充说，如果要求低收入者隔离14天，他们将向低收入者支付500英镑，或640美元，而那些隔离检疫人员将面临罚款。
