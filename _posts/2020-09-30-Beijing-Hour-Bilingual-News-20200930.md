It shows that China has suffered a steady increase in cyberattacks from outside its borders, with the U.S. being the largest source of cyberattacks against China.
它表明，中国遭受了来自境外的网络攻击的稳定增长，美国是对中国进行网络攻击的最大来源。
"China remains one of the main victims of cyberattacks, which have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. is the largest source of cyberattacks against China. The U.S. rank first in terms of the number of malicious programs caught on foreign computers, the number of malicious programs controlled on foreign servers, the number of distributed denial of service attacks on foreign computers, and the implantation of backdoors into Chinese websites."
“中国仍然是网络攻击的主要受害者之一，在COVID-19大流行期间，这种攻击有所增加。美国是对中国进行网络攻击的最大来源。就外国计算机上捕获的恶意程序的数量而言，美国排名第一。在外国服务器上控制的恶意程序的数量，对外国计算机的分布式拒绝服务攻击的数量以及将后门植入中国网站的数量。”
The report says the cyberattacks, with an average of more than 20,000 a day, are largely targeting network assets of industrial control systems in China.
该报告说，平均每天平均超过20,000次的网络攻击主要针对中国工业控制系统的网络资产。

According to the recent consensus reached between China and India, neither party should take any actions in the border area that will complicate the situation."

One million COVID-19 deaths 'a very sad milestone': WHO
世界卫生组织：100万例COVID-19死亡是“一个非常可悲的里程碑”
The World Health Organization says that one million deaths from COVID-19 is a very sad milestone.
世界卫生组织说，COVID-19造成100万人死亡是一个非常可悲的里程碑。
Global coronavirus deaths surpassed a million on Tuesday, with more than 33 million confirmed infections worldwide.
周二，全球冠状病毒死亡人数超过100万人，全球确诊感染人数超过3300万人。
However, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris says the virus can be suppressed.
但是，世卫组织发言人玛格丽特·哈里斯（Margaret Harris）说，该病毒可以被抑制。
"It's not too late to turn this around. Never think so. The one positive thing about this virus is it is suppressible, it's not the flu, it doesn't just go on and you can't do anything about it, you can and many countries have shown that."
“现在解决这个问题还为时不晚。永远不要这样想。关于这种病毒的一个积极的方面是它可以被抑制，它不是流感，它不仅会继续存在，而且您对此也无能为力，您可以而且许多国家都表明了这一点。”
It only took three months for COVID-19 deaths to double from half a million, an accelerating rate of fatalities since the first death was recorded in China in early January.
自1月初在中国记录第一例死亡以来，COVID-19的死亡仅用了三个月的时间就从50万增加了一倍，死亡率上升。

Germany's Merkel vows to avoid full national lockdown in pandemic
德国默克尔发誓要避免全国大范围封锁
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has unveiled new measures in response to rising coronavirus infections in the country.
德国总理安格拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）公布了针对该国日益增加的冠状病毒感染的新措施。
Merkel noted that some metropolitan areas have recorded a very significant increase in infections, causing great concern.
默克尔指出，一些大都市地区的感染已大大增加，引起了极大关注。
She says the plan involves quickly tracking infection chains and shutting down local outbreaks to avoid a nationwide lockdown.
她说，该计划包括迅速追踪感染链并关闭本地爆发，以避免全国范围内的封锁。
"We want to act regionally, specifically and purposefully, rather than shutting down the whole country again – that must be prevented at all cost. In order to achieve this we must have minimum standards for certain frequencies of infection."
“我们要在区域上采取具体，有目的的行动，而不是再次关闭整个国家–必须不惜一切代价防止。要实现这一目标，我们必须对某些感染频率制定最低标准。”
Merkel announced the new measures on Tuesday following a video-conference with the premiers of the federal states.
默克尔周二在与联邦州总理的视频会议后宣布了新措施。
Merkel warns that the number of infections could rise to 19,200 in three months if the rate of infection continues as it has done over the past three months.

U.S. states can learn from NY over virus fight
美国各州可以向纽约学习有关病毒的斗争
Health experts say states across the US can learn lessons from the comparatively strict coronavirus restrictions introduced in New York.
健康专家说，美国各地都可以从纽约引入的相对严格的冠状病毒限制中吸取教训。
Despite once having the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world, infection rates in the city have been relatively low for nearly three months.
尽管曾经是全球Covid-19病例数最高的城市，但该市的感染率近三个月一直相对较低。
But with unemployment soaring and fears of an impending second wave of the virus, not everyone is convinced authorities took the best course of action.
但是，随着失业率的飙升和对第二波病毒即将来临的担忧，并非所有人都相信当局采取了最佳措施。
Sarah Walton reports
莎拉·沃尔顿（Sarah Walton）报告
This is the sound that kept New Yorkers awake for days-on-end earlier this year.
这种声音使纽约人在今年初连续几天保持清醒。
At one point in April, more than eight hundred people here were dying every day from Covid-19 and hospitals were overwhelmed.
在4月的某个时刻，每天有800多人死于Covid-19，医院不堪重负。
But today, the city's infection rate stands at less than one percent, businesses have been slowly reopening and people say the sense of dread that once filled the streets has lifted.
但是今天，该市的感染率不到1％，企业正在缓慢地重新开放，人们说，一旦满大街，人们的恐惧感就已经消除。
"For now I do feel safe and everything has been cleaned, they're very sanitary, so for now I do."
“到目前为止，我确实感到安全，所有东西都已经清洁过，它们非常卫生，所以现在我可以了。”
"Everyone pretty much wears masks around here so I feel safe."
“每个人几乎都戴着口罩，所以我感到安全。”
"I love New York City we just gotta make sure we're healthy, keep our hands clean and keep the mask on"
“我爱纽约市，我们必须确保我们健康，保持双手清洁并戴好口罩”
While there are still an average of six coronavirus deaths a day in the city, public health experts say New York has made better progress than some parts of the US where some local infection rates are still growing.
尽管该市每天平均有6人死于冠状病毒，但公共卫生专家表示，纽约的进步要好于美国某些地方的感染率，而当地一些感染率仍在增长。
Dr Don Des Jarlais from the School of Global Public Health at New York University believes there are several reasons for that.
纽约大学全球公共卫生学院的Don Des Jarlais博士认为，其原因有很多。
"One is that New York is used to dealing with disaster. We had the AIDS epidemic, 9/11…so people have a sense that yes the city can cope. And then, while our political leaders were indecisive for a couple of weeks which really hurt, then they really become quite decisive as in 'this is real, we're gonna put New York on pause, everything is going to shut down'. And so people really took the restrictions very, very seriously."
“一个原因是纽约习惯于应对灾难。我们在9/11时患上了艾滋病，因此人们有一种感觉，这个城市可以应付。然后，尽管我们的政治领导人犹豫不决几周，真的很受伤，然后他们真的变得非常具有决定性，因为“这是真的，我们要让纽约暂停，一切都将关闭。”所以人们真的非常非常认真地考虑了限制。”
Nearly six months on, many of those restrictions are still in place. The city is full of signs reminding people to wear masks and stay six feet away from other people. And New York State now has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 testing in the country.
近六个月以来，许多限制仍然存在。这座城市到处都有标志，提醒人们戴口罩，与他人保持六英尺远。纽约州现在是该国Covid-19测试率最高的国家之一。
But while those precautions appear to be working…the city has so far avoided a predicted second wave of the virus)…economists say it has come at the expense of the economy.
但是，尽管这些预防措施似乎奏效了……但到目前为止，这座城市避免了预计的第二波病毒的侵袭）……经济学家说，这是以牺牲经济为代价的。
New York now has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at nearly 20%.
纽约现在是美国失业率最高的国家之一，接近20％。
But Professor Art Caplan, Head of Medical Ethics at NYU School of Medicine, says that if other parts of the US follow the example set by New York, they could avoid the same economic crisis.
但是纽约大学医学院医学伦理学负责人阿特·卡普兰教授说，如果美国其他地区效仿纽约树立的榜样，他们可以避免同样的经济危机。
"What I do think we've learnt though is that you're kind of doing a bit of a dance with the virus. We're not gonna go back to complete quarantine and shutdown - it's too devastating. But what we can say is that with better testing we could isolate more people, quarantine those that are positive or who have been exposed to somebody who was positive and not shut everything down."
“尽管如此，我确实认为我们已经了解到您正在与该病毒共舞。我们不会回过头来完成隔离和关闭-这太具有破坏性了。但是我们可以说的是通过更好的测试，我们可以隔离更多的人，隔离那些积极的人或暴露于积极的人而不会关闭一切的人。”
But public health experts say New York has not defeated the virus, it's simply managing it. And with schools set to soon reopen just as the autumn flu season begins, they warn that New York's resilience could be tested again.
但是公共卫生专家说，纽约并没有打败这种病毒，只是在管理它。而且随着秋季流感季节开始，学校将很快重新开放，他们警告说纽约的复原力可能会再次受到考验。

Japan witnesses record GDP slump due to pandemic
日本目睹大流行导致GDP下滑
Japan's economy has been hit by the biggest fall in GDP since World War Two due to the pandemic.
由于大流行，日本的经济遭受了第二次世界大战以来国内生产总值最大跌幅的打击。
Real wages are still falling, which means consumer spending will remain low. Small businesses have been feeling the brunt of the impact. But experts say it's not all doom and gloom - COVID-19 may be forcing change for the better in Japan's workforce.
实际工资仍在下降，这意味着消费者支出将保持较低水平。小型企业受到冲击的冲击最大。但是专家们说，这并不是所有的厄运和忧郁-COVID-19可能会迫使日本的劳动力队伍变得更好。
Grace Lee reports.
格蕾丝·李报道。

记者：
Lia Yew is a small business owner in Japan. She runs an eco-friendly fashion label.
Lia Yew是日本的一家小企业主。她经营一家环保时尚品牌。
"Tokyo Kaleidoscope breathes new life into vintage kimonos, by reconstructing them into beautiful, bespoke, modern-day pieces."
“东京万花筒将复古和服重构为美丽，定制的现代作品，为复古和服注入了新的活力。”
A state of emergency was declared in Tokyo in April, in which all non-essential businesses were asked to close.
4月在东京宣布进入紧急状态，所有非必需业务都被要求关闭。
Yew's business started to feel the pinch.
紫杉的生意开始感到紧绷。
"Obviously everything was put on hold for 2-3 months roughly - until they lifted the restrictions and people slowly started coming back but there was also that hesitancy to either place new orders, or commit to more designs because - though going through a lot of my clients minds as well was - well, where are we going to wear these new pieces?"
“显然，一切都搁置了大约2-3个月-直到他们解除了限制，人们慢慢开始回来，但由于下达了很多订单，所以还是犹豫不决，要么下新订单，要么承诺更多设计我的客户的想法也是-那么，我们将在哪里穿这些新作品？”
According to research firm Teikoku Databank, since February at least 500 companies in Japan have gone bankrupt due to the pandemic.
根据研究公司Teikoku Databank的数据，自2月以来，日本至少有500家公司因大流行而破产。
Topping the list were restaurants, hotels and apparel retailers.
餐馆，酒店和服装零售商位居榜首。
The central bank eased policy twice this year to pump money to cash-strapped small firms, complimenting two big government spending packages.
中央银行今年两次放宽政策，向资金拮据的小公司注入资金，称赞两个大型政府支出计划。
But consumer spending stayed low even after the state of emergency was lifted.
但是即使解除了紧急状态，消费者的支出仍然保持在低水平。
And experts say if that trend continues, more businesses will be in trouble.
专家说，如果这种趋势继续下去，将会有更多的企业陷入困境。
Shigeru Asaba is a professor of economics at Waseda University.

"In places like Tokyo and Osaka, manufacturing factories were already dealing with an ageing population - and having a hard time finding younger people to run the business, even before COVID-19. Now some of these businesses don't think it's worth the added effort with the pandemic in the mix, so they're giving up."
“在东京和大阪等地区，制造工厂已经在应对人口老龄化问题，而且甚至在COVID-19之前，都很难找到年轻人来经营这项业务。现在，其中一些企业认为这不值得增加努力应对大流行，所以他们正在放弃。”
Yew says she was able to fare better than others, because most of her business is done online.
紫杉说，她的业务表现比其他公司更好，因为她的大部分业务都是在网上完成的。
That's something companies across Japan have been struggling with - for years.
多年来，日本各地的公司一直在为此苦苦挣扎。
"There are things within Japan's society that needed change - and never did. Now, the pandemic is forcing that change. An example of that is digital transformation - teleworking and doing things remotely. We were forced to adapt, and then found that it was actually quite do-able"
“日本社会中有些事情需要改变-从来没有做过。现在，大流行正在迫使这种改变。数字化转型的一个例子是-远程办公和远程处理。我们被迫适应，然后发现它是实际上相当可行”
But it's still an uphill battle for Japanese companies and Yew says she's concerned about long-term impact as well.
但这对日本公司来说仍然是一场艰苦的战斗，Yew说她也担心长期影响。
"For me it will always be a bit worrying because fashion is not a necessity in life. And during these times perhaps individuals do not have the discretionary spending to treat themselves. As much as they want to support my business, and sustainable fashion for a better environment, they still have to pay their bills."
“对我来说，这总是有点令人担忧，因为时尚不是生活中的必需品。在这些时期，个人可能没有足够的可支配支出来对待自己。他们想支持我的业务，​​以及可持续发展的时尚。更好的环境，他们仍然必须支付账单。”
She was hoping to expand her business overseas this year but shipping and travelling restrictions have made that impossible.
她希望今年能将业务扩展到海外，但由于运输和旅行的限制，这一点变得不可能了。
She says she'll focus on growing her brand domestically instead.
她说，她将专注于在国内发展自己的品牌。

The U.S. criminal sanctions are truly the main cause of gross and widespread violations of human rights in the targeted nations and must be recognized."

Autonomous vehicles and flying cars of the future
未来的自动驾驶汽车和飞行汽车
The Beijing auto show is offering a glimpse of the future of driving, from autonomous vehicles to flying cars.
从自动驾驶汽车到飞行汽车，北京车展展现了驾驶的未来。
Toyota and Hongqi are both displaying autonomous driving cars.
丰田和红旗都在展示自动驾驶汽车。

中国初创公司Xpeng展出的是一款名为Kiwigogo的飞行器原型。
While flying cars may yet be a long way off from being on the market, manager Lin Huaibin of China Light Vehicle Sales Forecast at IHS Markit says autonomous vehicles may affect the auto industry in the next decade.
IHS Markit的中国轻型车销售预测经理林怀斌表示，尽管飞行汽车距离市场还有很长一段路要走，但在未来十年，自动驾驶汽车可能会影响汽车行业。
"Flying cars are definitely not within our forecast horizon yet because for us it still seems to be quite a distance away, but then autonomous cars, seriously, would theoretically have quite an impact in 10 years time because you see a lot of OEM or car companies now make a lot of investments on autonomous driving - (for example) Tesla with auto pilot. Although it's not close to full real auto pilot - where you don't need to look at the wheels and just read and play in cars, still we're not reaching that level but it's definitely the ultimate goal of a lot of car companies."
“飞行汽车肯定不在我们的预测范围之内，因为对于我们来说，它似乎还很遥远，但是从理论上讲，自动驾驶汽车将在10年的时间里产生重大影响，因为您会看到很多OEM或汽车公司现在在自动驾驶方面进行了大量投资（例如，具有自动驾驶功能的特斯拉），尽管它还不完全接近真正的自动驾驶功能，但您无需注视车轮，也无需在汽车上阅读和玩耍。我们没有达到这个水平，但这绝对是许多汽车公司的最终目标。”
China's major auto shows, held in Beijing and Shanghai in alternate years, are among the industry's biggest events, attracting global automakers and dozens of Chinese brands.
