China's carbon neutrality ambition hailed中国的碳中和野心鼓舞President Xi Jinping's pledge that China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 has been applauded.习近平主席关于中国将在2060年之前实现碳中和的承诺得到了鼓掌。Carbon neutrality refers to the total carbon dioxide emitted by human activity on a net basis equaling zero. It can be achieved by eliminating carbon dioxide emissions, or it can be accomplished by carbon offsets or removal.碳中和是指人类活动在净基础上排放的总二氧化碳等于零。可以通过消除二氧化碳排放来实现，或者可以通过碳补偿或清除来实现。Xi Jinping announced the goal while delivering a speech at the ongoing session of the United Nations General Assembly via video link.习近平在视频会议上在联合国大会进行中的演讲中宣布了这一目标。Isabel Hilton is the founder and editor of Chinadialogue.net, an independent, non-profit organization based in London and Beijing.伊莎贝尔·希尔顿（Isabel Hilton）是Chinadialogue.net的创始人和编辑，Chinadialogue.net是一家独立的非营利性组织，总部位于伦敦和北京。She says that China is in a good position to achieve this goal as the country is committed to renewable energy.她说，由于中国致力于可再生能源，中国处于实现这一目标的良好位置。"What I think climate analysts and activists would like to see is China with an even bigger commitment to renewable than to the traditional sources of energy. China is in a good position to move, its invested heavily in renewables. It's invested also in nuclear and in big hydro, and is now looking very seriously at the hydrogen economy is a lot of countries are, so there's a sense that we're on the edge of a number of possibilities if we can summon the political will. So as I say, the commitment from China to continuing with the Paris Agreement and enhancing its ambition is very welcome," said Hilton.“我认为气候分析家和激进主义者希望看到的是，中国对可再生能源的承诺比对传统能源的承诺更大。中国处于发展的有利位置，其对可再生能源的大量投资。它还投资了核能和在大型水电中，现在非常重视氢经济的国家很多，因此可以感觉到，如果我们能够唤起政治意愿，我们处于许多可能性的边缘。中国承诺继续执行《巴黎协定》并增强其雄心壮志，是非常欢迎的。”Renato Constantino is Executive Director of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, a climate and energy policy group based in the Philippines.雷纳托·康斯坦丁诺（Renato Constantino）是菲律宾气候与能源政策小组气候与可持续城市研究所的执行董事。He says China's plan is encouraging the whole world.他说中国的计划正在鼓舞全世界。"We think China is not only capable of achieving that goal, but that it is also capable of inspiring other countries. We think the speech delivered by President Xi is more than a speech. It is an act of leadership signaling to the world that leadership will come from new places, and that it was welcomed by many governments, especially developing countries' governments. It's a proof of the influence that China brings to issues of global importance with climate change being up the top of them."“我们认为中国不仅能够实现这一目标，而且还能够激励其他国家。我们认为习近平主席的演讲不仅仅是演讲。这是领导行为，向世界传达了领导力的信号。它将来自新的地方，并受到了许多政府特别是发展中国家政府的欢迎。这证明了中国对气候变化至上的全球重要性问题所产生的影响。”It's estimated that if China were to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality before 2060, it would lower global warming projections by around 0.2 to 0.3 Degrees Celsius.据估计，如果中国要在2060年之前实现碳中和的目标，它将把全球变暖的预测降低约0.2至0.3摄氏度。

Their exchanges with U.S. governments at all levels have been carried out with the aim of boosting mutual understanding, exchanges and cooperation. They are above board and their actions are beyond reproach."“中国驻美国使领馆以及各个团体和组织一向按照国际法和双边协定行事。他们与美国各级政府的交流旨在增进相互了解，交流与合作。他们的合作是不可或缺的。”The spokesperson also calls on U.S. politicians such as Pompeo to stop telling lies concerning China and to stop undermining normal bilateral exchanges and activities.发言人还呼吁庞培等美国政客停止对中国的谎言，并停止破坏正常的双边交流和活动。

China urges Australia to do more to enhance mutual trust中国敦促澳大利亚做更多工作以增进互信The Chinese government is urging Australia to do more to enhance mutual trust and benefit people from both sides.中国政府正在敦促澳大利亚做更多的事情，以增进互信，使双方人民受益。Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks after China banned two Australian researchers from entering the country.中国禁止两名澳大利亚研究人员进入澳大利亚后，外交部发言人王文彬发表了上述讲话。It's reported that Clive Hamilton accused China of influencing and infiltrating Western countries by stealing intelligence through public information and hacking, and that Alexander Joske accused Chinese universities of taking advantage of international cooperation to carry out cyberattacks and to steal military secrets.据报道，克莱夫·汉密尔顿（Clive Hamilton）指责中国通过公共信息和黑客手段窃取情报来影响和渗透西方国家，亚历山大·约瑟克（Alexander Joske）指责中国大学利用国际合作进行网络攻击并窃取军事机密。Wang says the decision to ban their entry is a matter entirely within China's sovereignty.王说，禁止他们入境的决定完全在中国主权范围内。"China welcomes foreigners to work, study and live in the country, give an objective account of China's national conditions and domestic and foreign policies, and enhance mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world. At the same time, we firmly oppose any act of spreading false information, deliberately attacking and discrediting China or endangering China's national security under the guise of academic research."“中国欢迎外国人在该国工作，学习和生活，客观地介绍中国的国情和国内外政策，增进中国与世界其他国家之间的相互了解。与此同时，我们坚决反对以学术研究为幌子散布虚假信息，蓄意攻击和侮辱中国或危害中国国家安全的行为。”The spokesperson says Australia has been repeatedly taking erroneous actions on issues concerning China's core interests and placing restrictions on their normal bilateral exchanges and cooperation.发言人说，澳大利亚一直在与中国的核心利益有关的问题上反复采取错误行动，并限制了两国的正常双边交流与合作。He says such moves have damaged mutual trust between both sides and placed their bilateral ties in a difficult situation.他说，这种举动破坏了双方之间的相互信任，使两国关系陷入困境。Wang urges Australia to stop stigmatizing China and to do more to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries.王建宙敦促澳大利亚停止对中国的侮辱，并为促进两国之间的相互了解和信任做更多的事情。
