“世界比过去长久以来更加分裂。您可以看到，在最生动的层面上，这是在安全理事会中，最近几个月在安全理事会中获得通过之后，没有得到通过。很难，很难达成协议。实质性问题。”

He says some powerful members should deeply reflect on what they want the UN to do.
他说，一些有权势的成员应该深刻反思他们希望联合国做什么。

COVID-19 situation in Brazil
巴西的COVID-19情况

Time to continue our special series "Guard against the resurgence of COVID-19," focusing on measures against a possible new wave of the coronavirus in autumn and winter.
是时候继续我们的特别系列“警惕COVID-19的复活了”，重点是针对秋季和冬季可能出现的新一轮冠状病毒的措施。

Brazil remains one of the world's hardest-hit countries, but it is hoping a vaccine will be ready soon to help alleviate the situation.
巴西仍然是世界上受灾最严重的国家之一，但它希望疫苗能早日准备来缓解这种情况。

Caren Moy has more.
卡伦·莫伊（Caren Moy）还有更多。

While many countries in Europe and Asia are entering their second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Brazil has yet to emerge from its first.
尽管欧洲和亚洲许多国家/地区正在进入第二次冠状病毒大流行，但巴西还没有从第一次流行中崛起。

Between May and September, an average of 1,000 Brazilians have died every day. The total number of deaths has topped 130,000 and at least 4.3 million people have been infected.
在5月至9月之间，每天平均有1000名巴西人死亡。死亡总数已超过13万人，至少有430万人被感染。

One major factor in the devastation caused by COVID-19 here is that many poor Brazilians live in cramped housing with no running water, making protocols recommended by the World Health Organization impossible to enforce.
造成COVID-19破坏的一个主要因素是，许多贫穷的巴西人住在狭窄的房屋中，没有自来水，这使得世界卫生组织建议的协议无法执行。

Dr. Margareth Dalcrome, pneumologist at the FIOCRUZ Research Institute, expands on the problem:
FIOCRUZ研究所的肺炎学家Margareth Dalcrome博士对此问题作了详细说明：

"I would say it's very difficult in this community to sort of come with this rhetoric of social distancing. How can you talk about social distancing in a house that is 15 square metres and where five people are living – with one or two rooms, one little kitchen and one little bathroom for everyone?"
“我想说的是，在这个社区中很难有这种社会隔离的言论。您怎么能谈论一间15平方米，五个人居住的房屋中的社会隔离，一间或两间房间，一间小厨房和每个人一个小浴室？”

The Brazilian government has come under heavy fire for its response to the pandemic. President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized for underplaying the severity of the pandemic and resisting measures to close down the economy.
巴西政府对这种大流行病的反应受到严厉抨击。总统贾尔·博尔索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）因低估了大流行的严重性而拒绝采取关闭经济的措施而受到批评。

Political commentator Mauricio Santorini describes the situation:
政治评论员毛里西奥·圣托里尼（Mauricio Santorini）描述了这种情况：

"What's happening now in Brazil is something without precedent in our history. Almost all the state governors in Brazil have united against the president, implementing measures to curb the pandemic. They want quarantine, they want social distancing. They want support from the Ministry of Health. The president is getting more and more isolated with each passing day, and it's like he is not part of the effort to fight the disease."
“巴西现在正在发生的事情在我们的历史上是史无前例的。巴西几乎所有州长都团结起来反对总统，采取措施遏制大流行。他们希望隔离，他们希望与社会隔离。他们希望得到巴西外交部的支持。健康。总统一天比一天变得越来越孤立，这就像他不是抵抗疾病的努力的一部分。”

Bolsonaro also dismissed two health ministers during the pandemic. He then installed army General Eduardo Pazuello – who has no health industry experience – as his interim health minister.
大流行期间，博尔索纳罗还解雇了两名卫生部长。然后，他任命没有卫生从业经验的陆军将军爱德华多·帕祖埃洛（Eduardo Pazuello）将军，担任临时卫生部长。

The insufficient response to the COVID-19 emergency has, in the opinion of many, resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths in Brazil. But the last week has brought some relief. The average daily death toll has fallen to 720. And interim Health Minister Pazuello announced the first nationwide COVID-19 testing programme, targeted at front-line workers.
许多人认为，对COVID-19紧急情况的反应不足，导致巴西成千上万不必要的死亡。但是上周带来了一些缓解。平均每日死亡人数已降至720。临时卫生部长Pazuello宣布了第一个针对前线工人的全国性COVID-19测试计划。

At the same time, due to Brazil's high infection rate, the country has become a testing ground for vaccine. candidates developed by Oxford University and China, respectively.
同时，由于巴西的高感染率，该国已成为疫苗的试验场。牛津大学和中国分别开发的候选人。

Dr. Dalcrome says that FIOCRUZ has already started mass producing the Oxford vaccine:
Dalcrome博士说，FIOCRUZ已经开始批量生产牛津疫苗：

"Brazil is taking on the risk of buying 30 million doses. We are going to start production right away. We will finalize the first batch of 15 million doses at the end of October, and the second one at the end of January next year. "
“巴西冒着购买3000万剂的风险。我们将立即开始生产。我们将在10月底完成第一批1500万剂，第二批在明年1月底完成。 ”

That means that by early next year the vaccines should be available to help stop the devastation caused by the coronavirus here in Brazil.
这意味着，到明年年初，应该可以使用疫苗来阻止巴西这里的冠状病毒造成的破坏。

"Every viewer has a choice about whether we end up with this virus going out of control. And it is it comes down to the individual choices of the 60 million people who live in this country as to whether we can keep it there with the local lock down approach or whether we have to take further national action."
“每个观众都可以选择是否最终导致这种病毒失控。这取决于该国6000万人口的个人选择，以及我们是否可以将其保留在当地锁定方法或我们是否必须采取进一步的国家行动。”

Hancock also says the UK is facing a tipping point in its fight against COVID-19 and could face stricter restrictions, including potentially a full national lockdown, if people don't follow government guidelines.
汉考克还表示，英国在对抗COVID-19的斗争中正面临一个临界点，如果人们不遵守政府的指导方针，英国可能会面临更严格的限制，包括可能全面封锁国家。

The government will help those on lower incomes who face a loss of earnings as a result of self-isolating with a one-time support payment of 500 pounds.
政府将向那些因自我隔离而面临收入损失的低收入者提供500英镑的一次性抚养费。

The national carrier of Kenya says it urgently needs a bailout of at least 500 million U.S. dollars to stay afloat.
肯尼亚这家国家航空公司表示，迫切需要至少5亿美元的援助以维持生计。

Kenya Airways chief executive Allan Kilavuka says the company has begun restructuring its business to remain competitive.
肯尼亚航空首席执行官艾伦·基拉维卡（Allan Kilavu​​ka）表示，该公司已开始重组其业务，以保持竞争力。

"We cannot keep an airline at 100 percent when the demand is only 50 percent. And that is why we need to restructure the airline. So, restructure (not) just the assets, restructure the operations itself, how we operate and then of course unfortunately even for employees and like you said, it is a very painful thing to do."
“当需求仅占50％时，我们不能使一家航空公司保持100％的运营。这就是为什么我们需要重组该航空公司。因此，重组（而不是）资产，重组运营本身，运营方式，然后当然不幸的是，即使对于员工来说，就像您所说的那样，这也是一件非常痛苦的事情。”

Revenue in the first half of the year dropped by almost 50 percent.
上半年收入下降了近50％。

The airline was forced to suspend both domestic and international flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it only resumed international operations last month.

It was flying to 55 destinations globally before the novel coronavirus struck, carrying four million passengers annually.
在新型冠状病毒袭击之前，它已飞往全球55个目的地，每年载有400万人次。
