     调查显示，中国的国家形象继续提高
     A global survey shows that China's image continues to improve.
     一项全球调查显示，中国的形象在不断改善。
     Eleven thousand respondents from over 20 countries participated in the 2019 China National Image Global Survey.

     Compared with previous surveys, the 2019 version adds topics including China's advocacy of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations and the general impression of China's national image since the founding of the People's Republic 70 years ago, covering politics, diplomacy, economy, culture, science and technology, among other fields.
     与以前的调查相比，2019年的调查增加了主题，包括中国倡导不同文明之间的交流和相互学习以及自70年前中华人民共和国成立以来对中国国家形象的总体印象，涵盖政治，外交，经济，文化，科学和技术等领域。

     U.S. international image plummets due to poor handling of pandemic
     由于对大流行的处理不善，美国国际形象暴跌
     A new survey says the poor response of the United States to the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the country's reputation among its key allies and partners.
     一项新的调查显示，美国对COVID-19大流行反应不佳，正在影响该国在主要盟友和合作伙伴中的声誉。

     Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin says China has always been and will continue to be a staunch defender of cybersecurity.

     "Not long ago, to address the data security risks which have become increasingly pronounced, China proposed a global data security initiative, which aims to maintain the security of global data and supply chain and promote the development of the digital economy."
     “不久前，为解决日益突出的数据安全风险，中国提出了一项全球数据安全计划，旨在维护全球数据和供应链的安全并促进数字经济的发展。”

     China strives to address imbalance in female and male teacher numbers
     中国努力解决男女教师人数失衡的问题
     Local authorities across China are striving to increase the number of male teachers in primary and secondary schools.
     中国各地的地方政府都在努力增加中小学的男教师人数。
     Zhou Fang has more.
     周芳有更多。
     In China, female teachers have outnumbered male teachers for a long time and the imbalance is particularly striking in primary and secondary schools.
     在中国，长期以来，女教师的数量已经超过了男教师，而且这种失衡在中小学尤为突出。
     In many primary schools, male teachers account for less than 30 percent of the total staff. In some less-developed regions, the ratio of male to female teachers is one to nine.
     在许多小学，男教师占员工总数的不到30％。在一些欠发达地区，男女教师的比例为1：1。
     China has taken a series of measures to address the problem, as there is growing evidence that the presence of male teachers is critical for the growth and development of students at certain ages.
     中国已经采取了一系列措施来解决这一问题，因为越来越多的证据表明，男教师的存在对于某些年龄段学生的成长和发展至关重要。
     Fujian Province has launched a program that provides free education for male students who want to become primary and middle school teachers after graduation.
     福建省启动了一项计划，为希望毕业后成为中小学教师的男学生提供免费教育。
     Primary school teacher Ye Chenghao was one of the beneficiaries.
     小学教师叶成浩是受益人之一。
     "I think male teachers play an important role in pupils' and junior middle school students' lives and studies. The presence of male teachers will make a student's life and studies more complete. We should learn to be as patient and careful as female teachers."
     “我认为男老师在小学生和初中生的生活和学习中起着重要作用。男老师的存在将使学生的生活和学习更加完整。我们应该学习像女老师一样耐心和谨慎。 ”
     Among students, male teachers are popular.
     在学生中，男老师很受欢迎。
     "Our Chinese teacher's classes are very interesting. He tells us jokes after class. He is just like an elder brother and he is very masculine."
     “我们的中文老师的课非常有趣。他在课后给我们讲笑话。他就像一个哥哥，而且他很阳刚。”
     "He is very devoted and humorous in class. We all love his classes."
     “他在课堂上非常敬业和幽默。我们都喜欢他的课堂。”
     Relatively low income has been regarded as a major factor discouraging young men from choosing a teacher career.
     相对较低的收入被认为是阻止年轻人选择教师职业的主要因素。
     To change the situation, all province-level regions in the country are now required to raise the average salary of teachers in compulsory education schools to the level for local civil servants by the end of this year.
     为了改变这种状况，现在要求该国所有省级地区在今年年底之前将义务教育学校的教师平均工资提高到当地公务员的水平。
     So far, several provinces have done more than expected.
     到目前为止，有几个省的工作超出了预期。
     Gao Ning is with the Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau in Zhejiang Province.
     高宁在浙江省杭州市教育局工作。
     "We were the first in the country to pledge higher pay for teachers than local civil servants."
     “我们是该国率先保证比当地公务员更高的教师工资的国家。”
     Other measures, such as bonuses and preferential housing policies, have also been adopted to make teaching a more attractive profession.
     还采取了其他措施，例如奖金和优惠住房政策，以使教学变得更具吸引力。
     Efforts are also urged to increase the social status of teachers and to work out preferential policies for male students applying for teaching-related majors in college admission exams.
     还敦促努力提高教师的社会地位，并制定针对男生申请大学入学考试专业的优惠政策。
     For the Beijing Hour, this is Zhou Fang.
     在北京时间，这是周芳。

     Germany under threat of 2nd COVID-19 wave
     德国受到第二次COVID-19威胁
     Time to continue our special series "Guard against the resurgence of COVID-19," focusing on measures against a possible new wave of the coronavirus in autumn and winter.
     是时候继续我们的特别系列“警惕COVID-19的复活了”，重点是针对秋季和冬季可能出现的新一轮冠状病毒的措施。
     As the northern hemisphere starts to cool off, epidemiologists are warning that the combination of COVID-19 and low temperatures could very possible mean a second wave could be just weeks away.
     随着北半球开始降温，流行病学家警告说，COVID-19和低温的结合很可能意味着第二波可能会在几周后发生。
     Evangelo Sipsas Reports.
     Evangelo Sipsas报告。
     Tourist season in Europe is almost over and most tourists are back home. But as many holidaymakers return with a more relaxed attitude and used to less social distancing restrictions, there are concerns among doctors and policymakers about a "second wave" in countries still reeling from the pandemic's first wave.
     欧洲的旅游旺季已经过去，大多数游客都回到了家。但是，随着许多度假者以更加宽松的态度​​返回并习惯于减少对社会隔离的限制，医生和政策制定者担心仍在从大流行的第一波中退缩的国家出现了“第二波”。
     France recorded almost 9,000 new cases, far higher than the previous record of 7,500 in March. Spain recorded nearly 9,000 new cases in a single day and in the UK more than 3,000 were infected in less than 24 hours.
     法国记录了近9,000例新病例，远高于3月份的先前记录7,500例。西班牙一天之内就记录了近9000例新病例，在英国，不到24小时就感染了3,000多例。
     Here in Germany Life has been returning to the 'new normal' over the summer. But now with rising numbers and autumn ahead, the government is faced with a large challenge.
     在德国，夏天以来，人们的生活已恢复到“新常态”。但是现在，随着人数的增加和即将到来的秋天，政府面临着巨大的挑战。
     Executive board member of the Doctors Association of Rhineland, Barbara Romer stresses her concern about a second wave.
     莱茵兰医生协会执行董事会成员芭芭拉·罗默（Barbara Romer）强调了她对第二波浪潮的关注。
     "That will be a big challenge because in addition to the corona virus, which is on the road all year round, then we will have on top the of that the annual cold viruses. And at the beginning of the new year, especially February - March, we will also have influenza again."
     “这将是一个巨大的挑战，因为除了一年四季都在流行的电晕病毒外，我们还将拥有每年的感冒病毒。在新年伊始，尤其是二月- 3月，我们也将再次患上流感。”
     As the weather is getting colder and in a few weeks temperatures will drop, the German government is faced with another dilemma: how do you stop a second coronavirus wave?
     随着天气越来越冷，几周后气温将下降，德国政府面临另一个难题：如何制止第二次冠状病毒浪潮？
     German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with all 16 regional leaders on imposing national wide measures to curb the infection rate.
     德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）同意所有16个地区领导人采取全国性措施来遏制感染率。
     Such measures require people arriving from countries that remain on Germany's travel warning list to self-quarantine for 14 days.
     此类措施要求来自仍在德国旅行警告名单上的国家/地区的人进行14天的自我隔离。
     Masks should be worn indoors and while using public transport as well as in schools or a fine up to 50 euros will be issued. And major public events are banned until next year.
     口罩应在室内，在使用公共交通工具以及在学校时佩戴，否则将处以最高50欧元的罚款。并且重大的公共活动被禁止到明年。
     The government also announced an increase of test capacity that could reach one million per week, but local nurse at the Westend Hospital in Berlin, Nicole Lebrun believes that Germany is not ready for a second wave.
     政府还宣布增加测试能力，每周可能增加一百万，但柏林西区医院的当地护士妮可·勒布伦（Nicole Lebrun）认为德国还没有为第二波做好准备。
     "As the situation is now, I believe that the German government and hospitals are prepared. But if a stronger wave does come, like what happen in France or Italy, then we are not, because simply we do not have enough nursing staff."
     “就目前的情况而言，我相信德国政府和医院已经做好了准备。但是，如果像法国或意大利那样发生一波更强大的浪潮，那么我们就不会这样做，因为我们没有足够的护理人员。”
     As the number of cases increase in Germany, so do the number of daily tests, which puts the government in a spot where they can still manage, but the dynamics could be a cause for concern as autumn approaches.
     随着德国案件数量的增加，日常检查的数量也随之增加，这使政府处在一个仍然可以管理的地方，但是随着秋天的临近，这种动态可能会引起人们的关注。

     Madrid mulls local lockdown as coronavirus cases spiral: official

     卫生当局说，需要采取行动，以防止新病例数量急剧增加而失去控制。
     Mari Cruz Martín from the Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine says the increasing number of infections has pushed medical capacity to its limit.
     西班牙重症监护医学会的玛丽·克鲁兹·马丁（Mari CruzMartín）表示，感染数量的增加使医疗能力达到了极限。
     "Many intensive care units are working beyond their normal resources even when they have already been increased, in a time when normally we'd be in a better situation so that's why we are concerned, because we don't know what our capacity will be in the coming months."
     “即使重症监护病房已经增加，许多重症监护病房仍在超出正常资源的情况下工作，而在通常情况下，我们会处于一个更好的状况，这就是我们关注的原因，因为我们不知道自己的能力会是什么在接下来的几个月中。”
     The capital and its surrounding towns and villages have seen more than 21,000 new cases over the last week.
     上周，首都及其周边的城镇和村庄共发生了21,000多例新病例。
     The measures could include "selective lockdown" within neighborhoods with the highest rates of infection.
     这些措施可能包括在感染率最高的社区内进行“选择性封锁”。
     Tuesday saw the total number of coronavirus cases in Spain pass 600,000, while there have now been over 30,000 deaths related to the virus.
     周二，西班牙冠状病毒病例总数超过60万，而与此病毒相关的死亡人数已超过30,000。




     Johnson: Second lockdown in UK would be a 'disaster'

     鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）在会上就其政府如何处理冠状病毒大流行向议会委员会发表讲话时发表了上述言论。
