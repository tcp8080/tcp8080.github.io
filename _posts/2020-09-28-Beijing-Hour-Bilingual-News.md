Remains of 117 Chinese soldiers killed in Korean War return
在朝鲜战争中丧生的117名中国士兵的遗体返回
The remains of 117 Chinese soldiers killed in the Korean War have been repatriated from South Korea.
在朝鲜战争中丧生的117名中国士兵的遗体已从韩国遣返。
Zhang Yun reports.
张云报道。
The remains of the fallen soldiers were sent to northeast China's Shenyang City on Sunday aboard a Chinese military transport aircraft.
下落的士兵的遗体星期天乘中国军用运输机被送往中国东北的沉阳市。
This is the seventh transfer of remains between the two countries since 2014, and the largest since 2015.
这是自2014年以来两国之间的第七次遗骸转移，也是2015年以来最大的遗骸转移。
The remains were put in coffins during a ceremony on Saturday and handed over to the Chinese side at Incheon International Airport yesterday.
遗体在星期六的仪式上被放进棺材，并于昨天在仁川国际机场移交给中方。
Last year, 103 sets of the remains were uncovered at Arrowhead Ridge inside the Demilitarized Zone, the site of one of the fiercest battles during the Korean War.
去年，在非军事区内的箭头岭发现了103套遗体，这是朝鲜战争中最激烈的战斗之一。
This was the first time that South Korea had carried out demining and excavation operation in this area.
这是韩国首次在该地区进行排雷和挖掘作业。
Along with the remains, over 1,300 items believed to have belonged to the killed soldiers were sent back to China. The items include personal seals of three fallen soldiers-- Ma Shixian, Lin Shuishi and Ding Zuxi.
除遗骸外，据信属于遇难士兵的1300多件物品被送回中国。物品包括马士先，林水石和丁祖锡三名阵亡士兵的个人印章。
During the handover ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Xing Haiming, draped each casket with the Chinese national flag.
在移交仪式上，中国驻韩国大使邢海明将每只棺材都悬挂着中国国旗。
"September 30 is the Martyrs' Day in China, and then come the 71st birthday of our motherland and the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional festival for family reunion in China. The martyrs return to homeland during this special period of time, and we send them our deepest sympathy and highest respect. "
“ 9月30日是中国的烈士纪念日，然后是祖国71周年诞辰和中秋节，这是中国传统的家庭团圆节。烈士们在这个特殊时期回到祖国，我们向他们表示最深切的同情和最崇高的敬意。”
The Chinese People's Volunteers fought alongside the Democratic People's Republic of Korea army in the Korean War against the South Korean army and the U.S.-led UN forces between 1950 and 1953.
在1950年至1953年之间的朝鲜战争中，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军队一起作战。
The handover of the remains usually takes place days before Tomb-sweeping Day, the Chinese holiday for commemorating the dead, in early April. But it was postponed this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
遗体的移交通常在清明节的前几天进行，清明节是4月初的中国人纪念死者的节日。但是由于COVID-19大流行，今年推迟了该计划。
Ambassador Xing says the handover embodies the spirit of the relationship between the two sides.
邢大使说，交接体现了两国关系的精神。
"In 2013, China and South Korea signed the agreement regarding the handover of the remains of Chinese soldiers killed in the war after friendly negotiation and pragmatic cooperation. This embodies the spirit of strategic relationship in the new era between the two countries. South Korea has returned the remains of 599 Chinese soldiers in the past 6 years, and the number rose to 716 soldiers this year. This is a great comfort to us."
“ 2013年，中韩两国经过友好谈判和务实合作，签署了移交在战争中丧生的中国士兵遗体的协议。这体现了两国之间新时代战略关系的精神。在过去6年中归还了599名中国士兵的遗体，今年这一数字上升到716名士兵。这对我们来说是一个极大的安慰。”
The remains will be buried in a martyrs' cemetery in Shenyang later today.
这些遗体将于今天晚些时候被埋葬在沉阳烈士陵园。
For the Beijing Hour, this is Zhang Yun in Seoul, South Korea.
在北京时间，这是韩国首尔的张云。

Hundreds protest in Madrid against partial lockdown, demand different approach
数百人在马德里抗议部分封锁，要求采取不同的方法
Hundreds of protesters have gathered in a working-class neighborhood in Madrid to protest the regional government's COVID-19 measures.
数百名抗议者聚集在马德里的一个工人阶级社区，以抗议地方政府的COVID-19措施。
Last week, authorities ordered mobility restrictions in areas where a total of 850,000 people live, sparking discrimination complaints and protests.
上周，当局下令在总共有850,000人居住的地区限制行动不便，引发歧视投诉和抗议活动。
Protester Raquel says the entire city of Madrid should be on lockdown and not just some areas.
抗议者拉奎尔说，整个马德里市应该处于封锁状态，而不仅仅是某些地区。
"We believe that the best thing would not be a confinement of affected neighbourhoods, but that those affected neighbourhoods should be provided with better health care and public attention, which is what we have not had in these months from the central government to the regions."
“我们认为，最好的事情不是将受影响的社区限制在其中，而是应该为那些受影响的社区提供更好的医疗保健和公众关注，这是我们从中央政府到地区这几个月来所没有的。 ”
The Madrid regional government says they chose specific areas because COVID-19 transmission levels had exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people.
马德里地方政府表示，他们之所以选择特定地区，是因为COVID-19传播水平已超过每10万人中的1,000。
Madrid extended a partial lockdown on Friday in several dozen districts with high infection rates.

The national government has recommended a city-wide lockdown and stricter restrictions in coronavirus hotspot as cases continue to surge in the capital.

“即使在COVID时代之前，我们还是非常热衷于通过口罩来保护自己，其中一些人可能会纳闷-哦，这真的有用吗？首先，口罩本身并不能保护病毒颗粒。因为颗粒太小，但是口罩可以身体保护自己不流口水。”
