COVID-19 safety app uses ultrasound for social distancing
COVID-19安全应用程序使用超声波进行社交疏散
A British railway infrastructure operator has been trialing a social-distancing app for its workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
在COVID-19大流行期间，一家英国铁路基础设施运营商一直在为其员工试用社交远程应用程序。
Zhou Fang has more.
周芳有更多。
Reporter:
记者：
Network Rail has kept services and stations running throughout the pandemic.
Network Rail在整个大流行期间一直保持服务和站点运行。
Its social-distancing app, "Mind the Gap," has been keeping its workers safe.
它的社交应用程序“ Mind the Gap”一直在确保其工人的安全。
"Mind the Gap" alerts smartphone users when they are too close to another app user by making an audible beep and displaying a "caution" alert onscreen.
当智能手机用户离另一个应用程序用户太近时，“提醒差距”会通过发出哔哔声并在屏幕上显示“警告”警报来提醒他们。
Network Rail has been trialing the app for months, including at its headquarters in the English city of Milton Keynes.
Network Rail已经对该应用程序进行了数月的试用，包括在其位于英国城市米尔顿凯恩斯的总部内。
Group director Martin Frobisher says over 1,000 workers have voluntarily installed the app on their company smartphones.
集团总监马丁·弗罗比舍尔（Martin Frobisher）说，有1000多名工人自愿在其公司的智能手机上安装了该应用程序。
He says there should be no privacy concerns as the app does not track users or gather specific user data.
他说，因为该应用程序不会跟踪用户或收集特定的用户数据，所以应该没有隐私问题。
"It's like a continuous electronic tape measure. It measures the distance between colleagues, but it doesn't track where they've been. It keeps no data records, it's just that continuous tape measure and continuous alert."
“这就像一个连续的电子卷尺。它测量同事之间的距离，但不跟踪他们去过的地方。它不保留任何数据记录，只是连续的卷尺和连续的警报。”
"Mind the Gap" was created by London-based rail tech startup, Hack Partners, as an alternative to social-distancing wearable devices, which are often more costly.
由伦敦铁路技术初创公司Hack Partners创立的“ Mind the Gap”是社交昂贵的可穿戴设备的替代产品，后者通常更昂贵。
Developers started working on it in April at the height of the UK's countrywide virus lockdown.
开发人员于4月在英国全国性的病毒封锁高峰期开始研究它。
Rather than relying on Bluetooth alone, like several contact-tracing apps, "Mind the Gap" uses Bluetooth to detect nearby devices and then uses inaudible ultrasound to calculate the distance between them.
而不是像几个联系人跟踪应用程序那样仅依靠蓝牙，“ Mind the Gap”使用蓝牙来检测附近的设备，然后使用听不见的超声波来计算它们之间的距离。
The technology does not require an active Internet connection.
该技术不需要活动的Internet连接。
Users can customize their preferred distance or even mute notifications if they're wearing personal protective equipment.
如果用户穿着个人防护设备，则可以自定义首选距离，甚至静音通知。
Hack Partners founder River Tamoor Baig says the app even works in users' pockets or handbags.
Hack Partners创始人River Tamoor Baig说，该应用程序甚至可以在用户的​​口袋或手提包中使用。
"We're looking for a very specific frequency of sound being played and a very specific melody as well. So, all the other noise, you know, we just completely disregard it. We don't even analyze that sound because it's not relevant for us."
“我们正在寻找一种非常特定的声音播放频率以及一种非常特定的旋律。因此，所有其他噪音，我们都完全忽略了它。我们甚至不分析该声音，因为它与声音无关为我们。”
The startup founder says they've been contacted by offices, manufacturers, charities and hospitals, all of whom are interested in rolling it out to staff.
这家初创公司的创始人说，办公室，制造商，慈善机构和医院已经与他们联系，所有这些人都希望将其推广给员工。
Since the app is not yet available in Apple or Google's app stores, they can't easily roll it out to smaller organizations and groups.
由于该应用程序尚未在Apple或Google的应用程序商店中提供，因此他们无法轻松地将其推广到较小的组织和团体。
The app currently only works on Apple's iOS operating system.
该应用程序当前仅可在Apple的iOS操作系统上运行。
Tamoor Baig says an Android version is "two to three weeks" away.
塔莫尔·拜格（Tamoor Baig）表示，“ Android”版本需要“两到三个星期”。

A robotics manufacturer in England has invented a personal motion system to help workers maintain correct social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
英国的一家机器人制造商已经发明了一种个人运动系统，以帮助工人在COVID-19大流行中保持正确的社交距离。
Wen Jie has more.
文杰还有更多。
All of Tharsus's 400 or so workers are wearing a personal motion system called Bump that alerts them when they get too close to a colleague.
塔瑟斯（Tharsus）的400名左右的工人中，所有人都穿着一种名为“凹凸”的个人运动系统，当他们与同事之间的距离太近时会发出警报。
The firm, which manufactures advanced machines and robots for companies including BMW and Rolls-Royce, conceived the technology in March as COVID-19 was spreading throughout the country.
该公司为宝马和劳斯莱斯等公司生产先进的机器和机器人，该公司在3月份构思了该技术，当时COVID-19正在全国范围内推广。
CEO Brian Palmer explains where they got the inspiration.
首席执行官Brian Palmer解释了他们从何处获得灵感。
"Before we had Bump, we were still encroaching on people's safe space. So, Bump just gives you that nudge just to say; 'Be careful, step back.' Without being awkward, without one person feeling like they're encroaching on somebody else."
“在我们获得Bump之前，我们仍在侵犯人们的安全空间。因此，Bump只是想告诉您说：'小心，后退。'不用尴尬，没有一个人会感觉到他们在侵犯别人。”
Technical officer Rebecca Henry says they're comfortable with wearing Bump.
技术官员丽贝卡·亨利（Rebecca Henry）说，他们对穿凹凸感很满意。
"At the start, it was quite awkward because you're kind of like; 'Oh, you getting too close.' Whereas now, everyone realizes it's not having to go at anyone else or trying to pick faults, it's for our safety and for everyone else's safety."
“一开始，这很尴尬，因为你有点像；'哦，你离得太近了。'现在，每个人都意识到不必去找其他人或试图挑剔，这是为了我们的安全和所有人的安全。”
Bump is described as an "electronic safety bubble" that projects a two-meter safety zone around its wearer.
凹凸被描述为“电子安全泡沫”，在其穿戴者周围投射出两米的安全区域。
It uses low energy Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio to attain precise location data, tracking how close devices come into each other and for how long.
它使用低能耗的蓝牙和超宽带无线电获取精确的位置数据，跟踪设备之间的接近程度以及持续时间。
When you get within two meters of someone else, the device turns blue while making a single audible beep. When you get to within one meter, it flashes red and makes a continuous beep.
当您与他人相距两米以内时，设备会发出一声哔哔声，同时变成蓝色。当您到达一米之内时，它会闪烁红色并发出连续的蜂鸣声。
Bosses can use the information to reconfigure workplaces and reduce bottlenecks or find out if workers might need to change their behaviors.
老板可以使用这些信息来重新配置工作场所并减少瓶颈，或者找出工人是否可能需要改变其行为。
The device has become invaluable to the company in the past several weeks, when one Tharsus worker contracted a mild case of COVID-19.
在过去的几周中，当一名Tharsus工人感染了轻度的COVID-19病例时，该设备已成为该公司的无价之宝。
CEO Brian Palmer says eleven employees were sent home, but all tested negative later and the factory wasn't forced to close down.
首席执行官布莱恩·帕尔默（Brian Palmer）说，有11名员工被送回家，但后来全部测试均为阴性，因此工厂没有被迫关闭。
"If we have an outbreak, we can track and trace in minutes and really accurately with a really high degree of confidence that we understand exactly who that individual's been close to over a period of time, so we can react very quickly."
“如果我们爆发了疫情，我们可以在几分钟内真正准确地进行跟踪和追踪，并且具有非常高的信心，我们可以准确了解某个人在一段时间内与谁接近，因此我们可以迅速做出反应。”
The device costs about 100 dollars each.
该设备每台售价约100美元。
A number of firms have shown interest in the technology.
许多公司已经对该技术表现出兴趣。
Brian says after the successful pilot, they plan to roll out the wearable devices to sites around the world.
Brian说，在成功试点之后，他们计划将可穿戴设备推广到世界各地。
For the Beijing Hour, this is Wen Jie.
对于北京小时，这是温洁。

Nestle says COVID fears boosted appetite for plant-based food
雀巢称COVID担忧加剧了对植物性食品的需求
Food giant Nestle has said the consumer appetite for plant-based food has increased due to crisis-related health concerns and supply disruptions.
食品巨头雀巢表示，由于与危机相关的健康问题和供应中断，消费者对植物性食品的需求有所增加。
Chief Executive Mark Schneider explains.
首席执行官马克·施耐德（Mark Schneider）解释说。
"There were supply chain issues in meat especially in North America and that has increased interest in plant-based alternatives. And then, obviously, people do have a renewed interest in personal health and losing weight as you know, COVID particularly affected those that have some pre-existing health conditions or maybe overweight or obese and so, clearly, there is a renewed interest in more healthy nutrition."
“特别是在北美，肉类存在供应链问题，人们对植物替代品的兴趣日益浓厚。然后，很明显，人们确实对个人健康和减肥产生了新的兴趣，COVID特别影响了那些一些以前已经存在的健康状况，或者可能是超重或肥胖，因此，显然，人们对更健康的营养有了新的兴趣。”
The world's biggest packaged food company has invested heavily in the competitive market for plant-based products, which is dominated by players like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods in the U.S.
这家全球最大的包装食品公司已经在竞争激烈的植物基产品市场上进行了巨额投资，而该市场以美国的Beyond Meat和Impossible Foods等企业为主导。
It is launching a plant-based Nesquik milk drink this week and a new version of its vegan burger.
该公司本周将推出一种基于植物的Nesquik牛奶饮料，以及其素食汉堡的新版本。
Schneider says he expects prices for plant-based meat alternatives to fall over time, but says they reflect the higher cost of ingredients such as pea or soy protein.
施耐德说，他预计植物性肉替代品的价格会随着时间下降，但他说，这反映出诸如豌豆或大豆蛋白等成分的成本较高。
"At the present times, these are premium priced products some of that reflects of course the more expensive ingredients and also scarcer ingredients that may be only ramping up over the time as demand develops. So, I would expect over time that prices will become more competitive and we're working hard to make this an accessible product."
“目前，这些产品都是高价产品，这些产品中的一些当然反映了更昂贵的成分以及稀有成分，这些成分可能只会随着需求的增长而逐渐增加。因此，我希望随着时间的推移，价格会越来越高。具有竞争力，我们正在努力使它成为可访问的产品。”
Nestle's sales of plant-based foods increased 40 percent in the first half of 2020 after reaching 215 million US dollars last year.
雀巢植物性食品的销售额在去年达到2.15亿美元之后，在2020年上半年增长了40％。
